Description:
-------

The Seven+ Calculator is designed to be a simple, user friendly calculator inspired by the Metro UI design language. It is meant to be as extensible as possible, allowing for the arrangement of buttons to be reworked in XML without having to touch any Java. Otherwise it offers all of the basic calculator functionality like vibration on button press, an accent color, custom status bar, animations, auto-resizing number display, percent calculation... dare I continue.

How to build:
-------

You CANNOT build this application in its current state because it relies on the WP7UI Android Library Project that is owned by Thomas James Barrasso. This library is not open source <i>at this time</i>. This may leave you asking, why open source the application then? The answer is simple: to allow other developers to use the same method to create their own calculator applications, perhaps even a themable one! You will notice that this application has very few assets and that is because in the WP7UI Library ALL icons are drawn in code using the android.graphics.Canvas class. This is to make inclusion of the library simplier (no resources means no dependencies/ struggles) and allows for the most accurate information (the battery can be from 0 - 100 without 100 different images!
